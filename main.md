The Partitions became a focal point in European political discourse for years to come, and a rallying call for the oppressed nations in all.

For instance, they were mentioned in _"Il Canto degli Italiani"_, the Italian National Anthem, written in 1847, and were a major topic of discussion in The American _Federalist Papers_ (1787-1788).

<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/sejmCongressPoland.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

### The Kingdom of Poland
Colloquially named **Congress Poland** was governed by the 
###### Sejm of Congress Poland
###### (_Sejm Królestwa Polskiego_] 
between 1815 to 1831.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/sejmCongressPoland.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

On the 27 of November 1815 the **Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland** (_Konstytucja Królestwa Polskiego_) was signed by the Tsar and King of Poland, **Alexander I**.


Roman Catholicism was recognized as the religion of the state, but other religions were tolerated.

Liberty of the press was promised subject to the passing of a law to restrain its abuses.

Individual liberty, the use of the Polish language in the law courts, and the exclusive employment of Poles in the civil government were secured by the constitution.
{Steed, Henry Wickham, David Hannay, and W Alison Phillips. “A Short History of Austria-Hungary and Poland.” London: The Encyclopaedia Britannica Co., 1914. file://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006568137.p.137 | 1}
--

But in 1819 Alexander I limited the freedom of the pressand introduced  heavy censorship.
Russian secret police commanded by **Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev** started infiltration and persecution of Polish clandestine organizations, and in 1821 the Tsar ordered the abolition of freemasonry.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/sejmCongressPoland.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

Under Article 3 (On the Namiestnik and Council of State) of the new constitution, the office of the 
###### _**Namiestnik**_ 
was introduced (Polish: namiestnik Królestwa Polskiego, Russian: наместник Царства Польского) as the deputy of the King of Poland (Tsar of Poland).

### Namiestniks of the Kingdom of Poland

<div style="font-size:75%">
    <ol>
        <li> Józef Zajączek (1815–26)</li>
        <li> Vacant, 1826–31 (power and responsibilities were exercised by the Administrative Council)</li>
        <li> Ivan Paskevich (1831–55)</li>
        <li> Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorczakow (1855 – 3 May 1861)</li>
        <li> Nikolai Sukhozanet (16 May 1861 – 1 August 1861)</li>
        <li> Karl Lambert (1861)</li>
        <li> Nikolai Sukhozanet (11–22 October 1861)</li>
        <li> Alexander von Lüders (November 1861 – June 1862)</li>
        <li> Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia (June 1862 – 31 October 1863)</li>
        <li> Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg (1863–74)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

--

The importance and role of the Namiestniks changed throughout the periods.
Certainly from 1815 to 1831 the Congress Kingdom's military was controlled by **Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich** of Russia, who _de facto_ had more power than the namiestnik, **Józef Zajączek**. 
--
Zajączek died in 1826 and was not replaced until 1831, when the November 1831 Uprising saw **Ivan Paskevich** assume the post of namiestnik—as well as command of Russian military forces in the region, as he was tasked with defeating the Uprising. 
The question of who controlled the military after Paskevich's death is unclear, but again the last namiestnik, **Fyodor Berg**, was tasked with crushing another Polish uprising—the January 1863 Uprising—and commanded the military.

Upon Nicolas I succession, the crown began limiting the liberties that existed under the constitutional monarchy in Congress Poland, whose predecessor, Alexander I, famously bestowed in his liberal-leaning approval of the 1815 Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland. 

After 1825 the Polish Sejm was forced to hold its sessions in secret, while Nicholas I formally crowned himself as King of Poland on 24 May 1829 in Warsaw, to the dismay of the Polish political elites.

![](./pics/Piotr_Wysocki.png) <!--.element: style="width: 200px; float: right;right:-50px;z-index: 100;position: relative;"-->

In 1828, under the command of Lt. **Piotr Wysocki** of the Warsaw School of Cadets, a conspiracy to assassinate the the Grand Duke Constantine was hatched. 

It took time for the conspirators to materialize their aspirations, though. But eventually the political turmoils of 1830 drove the delicate balance over the edge.

--

In July a revolution broke out in France, and in August the Belgians began rising for their independence from the Netherlands. These insurrections led the Tsar to prepare for an armed intervention against Belgium, and possibly even France.

On the 19th of November the crown announced a state of increased combat readiness for the Russian Army and the Russian controlled Polish troops.

The cadets decided to take immediate action.
--

It was planned to take place on the 29th of November 1830 - when the lieutenant interrupted an evening tactics class and proclaimed:

<blockquote>
Poles! This is the hour of revenge. Today, we must triumph or perish! Let us charge, and let your breasts be the Thermopylae for your enemies! 
</blockquote>

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1830warsawPark.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->

The soldiers then proceeded to attack the Belweder Palace, the main seat of the Grand Duke, but failed to capture him. They then captured the city's main arsenal, while in the following days Polish civilians took arms and forced the Russian troops to withdraw north of Warsaw.  

--

In reply to the rapid and unexpected turn of events, the Polish government (Administrative Council) assembled immediately. It was decided that unpopular ministers were to be removed and men like Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, the historian Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and General Józef Chłopicki take their places. 

--
<blockquote>
Czartoryski had been rightly described as the central but not
the leading figure of the insurrection. He did not seek power. He
assumed the presidency in part because he felt a sense of duty
toward his countrymen and his name attracted the support of the
nobility, and in part because his life-long experience in diplomacy
uniquely qualified him to conduct his country's foreign policy. The
prince was not a born leader of men, and he was often unfortunate
in his choice of associates. {Wandycz, Piotr Stefan. The Lands of Partitioned Poland, 1795-1918, 1974. https://getit.library.nyu.edu/link_router/index/125880316. p.110 |1}
</blockquote>

--

The situation in the Kingdom further radicalized. On December 20, the Parliament issued a manifesto in which it announced a national uprising against Russia, presenting to the nations of the world its reasons for the rebellion.

On October 5, 1831, in the vicinity of Brodnica, the last branch of a large Polish army (20,000 soldiers) crossed the border to Prussia, where he was interned, and on October 9th, the Modlin Fortress capitulated, and the fortress Zamosc on the 21 October.

The latter date is considered to be the end of the November Uprising.

<blockquote style="font-size:70%;">
After the collapse of the insurrection the Polish political, ideological, and cultural center shifted abroad. Plans for an emigration en masse existed already in the last stages of the war and resulted in the departure of most members of the government, ministers, many Sejm deputies, generals, junior officers, and common soldiers. A large number of the leaders of the Left went abroad hoping to achieve, in cooperation with Western revolutionaries, the political ascendency that had eluded them in the kingdom. The emigres numbered some nine thousand people. Two-thirds of them were of noble background-although few were magnates-and one-third were of urban-plebeian or peasant origin. Officers outnumbered common soldiers. As a result of this exodus, Paris, where many of the emigres settled, became a veritable headquarters of Polish national life. The emigration represented an elite of the nation and counted among its members some of the greatest names in Polish literature, history, music, and political thought. {Wandycz, Piotr Stefan. The Lands of Partitioned Poland, 1795-1918, 1974. https://getit.library.nyu.edu/link_router/index/125880316. p.117 |1}

<blockquote style="font-size:75%;">
Historians call this phase the 'Great Emigration'. This name is somewhat misleading, since it may imply that very large numbers of Poles left their country. In fact, the number of emigrants, who should more appropriately be called 'exiles', probably did not exceed 5000-6000 at any time between I83I and the beginning of great economic migration in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The 'Great Emigration' was primarily a self-imposed exile of members of the revolutionary government and diet of 1830-1. [...]

In addition to the politicians, some officers and men who were released from Prussian or Austrian internment camps sought refuge in France, England and Switzerland. However, the greatness of this emigration lay not in its military significance but rather in its contribution to the maintenance of Polish cultural values suppressed in Poland by the Occupying Powers.{Zubrzycki, J. “Emigration from Poland in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries.” Population Studies 6, no. 3 (1953). http://www.jstor.org/stable/2172378. p.248| 1}

A wave of Polonophilia swept over Jacksonian America; when hardly a day went by without some sympathetic mention of Poland in newspaper editorials; when banners for the Polish insurgents were dedicated in Boston, Polish dances were taught in New York dancing schools, a plethora of amateur verse on Polish themes found its way into print, and public protest meetings and collections were undertaken throughout the country. {Wieczerzak, Joseph. “American Reactions to the Polish Insurrection of 1863.” Polish American Studies, 1965, p.92| 1}

<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/Zanonni_Carte_De_La_Pologne.jpg" class="text-bg-clr"-->
In the decades following the November Uprising both sides of the Polish nationalist spectrum saw little success in raising the masses or in the international sphere, even though the 1840s saw a few disturbances around Greater Poland.

Overall - <br>
##### <q>"Order Reigns in Warsaw"</q> { The infamous words of the French foreign m inister <b>Horace Sébastiani</b> in the Chamber of Deputies about situation in Poland. <br> September 16 1831 |1}

But the cultural leaders of the Great Emigration worked to sustain the Polish national spirit and its cause in the European public sphere.

Up until the first turmoils in Warsaw, one could say that the Russian occupation operated through a regime of repression and appeasment.

#####  Михаил Димитрович Горчаков

![](./pics/Gorczakow.png) <!--.element: style="width: 200px; float: right;right:-50px;z-index: 100;position: relative;"-->

Appointed in 1856 by Alexander II as the governor of the Polish Kingdom .
--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1861Warsaw2.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

"The regime was universally disliked, but it was not universally opposed" {Kieniewicz, Stefan. “Polish Society And The Insurrection Of 1863.” Past and Present 37, no. 1 (1967): 130–48. doi:10.1093/past/37.1.130. p.132 | 1}

Most of the occupation army was composed of Poles, and "in some way, every social group collaberated with the hated regime" {ibid |1}

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1861Warsaw6.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->
<blockquote>
The peasant alone had no share in this collaboration, but it was the peasant who tended to expect an improvement in his condition from 'the good emperor' {ibid | 1}
</blockquote>

<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1861Warsaw4.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

In June of 1860, the streets of Warsaw became the place of marches and demonstrations. They began with a display of Sowińska general's funeral,the widow of the legendary commander of the defense of Wola in 1831.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863battle1.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->

Then came the demonstrations during the October conference of the leaders of the occupying powers, and demonstrations on the anniversary of the November uprising and its subsequent anniversaries of events.

Gorczakow did not initially respond to the demonstrations, it was only under the pressure of St. Petersburg that police and military were sent to the streets of Warsaw. 

The first procession dispersed February 25, 1861, and two days later a volley of Cossacks sent to quite the demonstrators killed five people.


--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/DelegacjaMiejska.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

Gorczakow, fearing that further clashes could erupt into open fighting,  first withdrew the army from the streets and agreed to set up, on the night between the 27 and 28 of February, a **City Delegation** (Delegacja Miejska) issued on behalf of society Polish address to the Tsar.

<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/DelegacjaMiejska.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

It was composed of 14 members, representing different classes of the town. They were:

<ul class="small">
 <li> Banker Leopold Kronenberg </li>
 <li> Writer Józef Ignacy Kraszewski </li>
 <li> Doctor Tytus Chałubiński </li>
 <li> Photographer Karol Beyer </li>
 <li> Merchant Franciszek Ksawery Szlenkier</li>

 <li> Attorney August Trzetrzewiński</li>
</ul> 

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/DelegacjaMiejska.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

Together with representatives of the Agricultural Society, the delegation drafted an address Emperor Alexander II, submitted to the governor of the Polish Kingdom Mikhail Gorczakow .

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1861Warsaw3Newspaper.png" class="text-bg-bw"-->

But the Tsar refused to accept the delgation's address, and Gorczakow, recognizing the danger of an uprising, concealed the fact of the rejection, agreed to ostentatious funerals of the victims of the February clashes, ordered the army and police to withdrew from the streets, and entrusted the policing to vigilante.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863battle2.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->

At this point in the political saga appeared Margrave **Aleksander Wielopolski**, leader of the compromising faction, professing the idea of _organic work_. Wielopolski received a promise from Gorczakow to transfer the supervision of the education system to the Polish noble, to re-activate the Polish higher education and to create a local government in the Kingdom.

### Alexander Wielopolski (1803-1877)

![](./pics/Zamoyski.png) <!--.element: style="width: 200px; float: right;right:-50px;z-index: 100;position: relative;"-->

The disbanding sparked a demonstration in Castle Square in Warsaw which, in the Polish public opinion, though is doubtful corrabarated by the actual events, saw 100 people killed and approximately 200 wounded.

A protest on anniversiry of the death of Tadeusz Kościuszko (1817) - whose failed uprising in 1794 against the Russian opressors made him a martyr of the Polish national cause - turned violent, when crown soldiors fired shots at the agitated crowd.

<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863battle4.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->

Thus in 1861 the status-quo abruptly collaped. 

The triumph of Garibaldi, and the achivments of Cavour excited both the patriotic youth and the nationalist elites, while an atmosphere of pending reforms hung in the air.

## Immediate political consequences

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863battle6.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
#### The rise of political, revolutionary and secret societies

<blockquote style="font-size:85%;">
There were dozens of conspiratorial groups in Warsaw in the middle of 1861, but it may be doubted whether they had more than two thousand or so members in all, consisting mainly of students, officers, clerks, and some artisans and workmen (though they represented only a minority of the working class). All these groups were eventually united by the so-called "Town Committee", later known as the Central National Committee. 
</blockquote>

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/woundedPoles2.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
But less then 2 years later:

<blockquote>
On the eve of the outbreak of the insurrection the secret organization counted upon about 20,000 members. According to some of the evidence, there were 8,000 supporters in Warsaw alone, of whom 80 per cent were artisans and workmen;and it would certainly seem that at least half of the Warsaw artisans and workmen belonged to the conspiracy, a very high percentage indeed.
</blockquote>
--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/vetransPhoto.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
## The Red and White factions

The future leaders of the uprising gathered secretly in St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Vilna, Paris and London. After this series of meetings two major factions emerged. The Reds represented united peasants, workers, and some clergy, while The Whites represented liberal minded landlords and intelligentsia of the time. In 1862 two initiative groups were formed for the two components of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/woundedPole.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The whites 

The aristocratic Conservatives were centred in the Hotel Lambert in Paris with Prince Adam Czartoryski as their leader. They established a quasi-government-in-exile.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/russiansDemolish.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The whites 

The "Whites" (Polish: Biali) consisted mainly of progressive minded gentry and industrialists, the middle-class and some intellectuals of. The faction had its origins in the Agricultural Society.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863photo2.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The whites 
While the Whites supported ending serfdom, they were opposed to the "Red" _Democratic Society_ idea of total re-distribution and called for compensations to be made to the landlords. More importantly, the Whites generally opposed the idea of an armed insurrection against Russia, seeing it as doomed to failure, and instead advocated for a diplomacic route and wooed the European powers for support, a separate administration and a native Polish army. 

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/polishCaptives.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The whites

They also tried to influence the Tsar to engage in the recovery of former Polish lands which had been taken by partitioning powers other than Russia - Austria and Prussia. However, once the January Uprising broke out, most Whites supported it both politically and militarily.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/derailingTransport.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The Reds

The Polish Radicals espoused democratic, republican and sometimes socialistic ideas. Their National Committee, established in Paris and later moved to Brussels, purported to represent the Polish nation, and had as its key figure the historian **Joachim Lewelel**. 
--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/1863photo.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->
### The Reds
They supported the outbreak of the uprising from the outset, advocated an end to serfdom and future independent Poland, without compensation to the landlords, land reform and other substantial social reforms.

<img data-src="./pics/centralComitee.jpg" width="400"> <!--.element: style="width: 200px; float: right;right:-50px;z-index: 100;position: relative;"-->
The Central National Committee (Komitet Centralny Narodowy) formed the leadership basis of the faction.

--
<!--.slide: data-background-image="./pics/radomForest.png" class="text-bg-clr"-->

In general, the Reds represented liberal intellectuals while the Whites based their support on progressive landlords. The Reds were based in Warsaw and concentrated around the Warsaw Medical Academy, while the Whites' base of support was in Kraków.

## January Uprising

--
### Nikolay Milyutin (1818 – 1872)

![](./pics/Nikolay_Milyutin.png) <!--.element: style="width: 200px; float: left;left:-50px;z-index: 100;position: relative;"-->

The famous architect of Alexander II's liberal reforms was dispached to Poland to implement reforms. He orchestrated an emancipation of the peasantry at the expense of the nationalist landowners and the expulsion of Roman Catholic priests from schools. Russificaion on the one hand, and appeasment of the lower-classes on the other.

On the 14th of January 1863, a sudden attempt by the Tsar to crack down on potential political agitators and nationalist ne'er-do-wells was attempted by a decree of a mass conscription into the Imperial Army.
The aspiring revolutionaries - revolted, took to the woods and took up arms against the foreign regime. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. The insurrectionists, severely outnumbered and lacking serious outside support, were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics.

<blockquote>
Having read about the beginning of the revolt from newspapers, Dostoevsky began his private notebook of 1863 with the question: ‘‘What is the real war?— The Polish war is the war of two Christianities [Christian denominations— N.P.], this is the beginning of the future war of Russian Orthodox Christianity with Catholicism, in other words—of the Russian genius and European civilization. Here the progress is ours—and not an official progress (in agreement with the Dutch formula), but the peoples’ progress.’’ { F. M.

## The underground government
Piłsudski: "The greatness of our nation in the great epoch of 1863 consisted in its government, which, unknown by name, was respected and obeyed in a manner that should make all countries and all nations jealous" {A lecture delivered in 1924 entitled Rok 1863 [The Year 1863] Józef Piłsudski o powstaniu 1863 roku [Józef Piłsudski on the January uprising] (London, 1963), p. 153. |1}

### The Polish professional revolutionary exiles

--
<blockquote>
I can only say that the insurrection, however much of heroism and patriotic devotion it has subsequently embodied, appears to me to have been to a great extent artificially stimulated by the wonderfully dextrous managment of the press and the telegraph and by a social machinery which no other nation than one of generations of illustrious exiles can command.

"While it is often and quite justifiably remarked that there was hardly a barricade or battlefield in Europe between 1830 and 1870 where no Poles were fighting, this is especially true for the revolution of 1848/1849." {Dowe, Dieter.

#### The Polish Propoganda

'The Russian Consul General had earlier written letters to the _Morning Post_, May 16 and 21, countering the stories of Russian atrocities. at least one Russian writer pressed the (Russian?) Minister of War in June to increase Russian propoganda: "It is known the the Polish party spends enormous sums on attracting all the organs of the public opinion in Western Europe to its side and that it organized what could be called a whole factory for news and articles..." {McCauley, Martin, and Peter Waldron. The Emergence of the Modern Russian State, 1855–81. London: Palgrave Macmillan UK, 1988 <br> p.163 <br> Cited by F.

## Visit of the Russian fleet

During the winter of 1861–1862, the Imperial Russian Navy sent two fleets to American waters to avoid their getting trapped if a war broke out with Britain and France. Many Americans at the time viewed this as an intervention on behalf of the Union, though historians deny this.[53] The Alexander Nevsky and the other vessels of the Atlantic squadron stayed in American waters for seven months (September 1863 to June 1864){Thomas A. Bailey, "The Russian Fleet Myth Re-Examined," Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Jun., 1951), pp. 81–90| 1}

The Continental Monthly, a magazine owned by Mrs. Martha Cook, one of the rare American workers for the Polish cause at the time, published two articles in 1864. One, printed in the January issue under the French title "Nos Amis les Cosaques/" was an indictment of America's Russophilia by Michael Heilprin, the son of a well-known rabbinical family and a secretary of the Washington Polish Committee.{Wieczerzak, Joseph. “Pre-and Proto-Ethnics: Poles in the United States Before the Immigration ‘After Bread.’” The Polish Review 21, no. 3 (1976): 7–38. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25777399. p.34 |2}
