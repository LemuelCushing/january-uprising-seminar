### The Polish professional revolutionary exiles

<q>
I can only say that the insurrection, however much of heroism and patriotic devotion it has subsequently embodied, appears to me to have been to a great extent artificially stimulated by the wonderfully dextrous managment of the press and the telegraph and by a social machinery which no other nation than one of generations of illustrious exiles can command.

# 1830-31 Uprising
November Uprising

Walerian Łukasiński - (15 April 1786 in Warsaw – 27 January 1868 in Shlisselburg) was a Polish officer and political activist. Sentenced by Russian Imperial authorities to 14 years' imprisonment, he was never released and died after 46 years of solitary incarceration, becoming a symbol of the Polish struggle for independence.

After November Uprising Tsar Nicholas I of Russia became convinced that even imprisoned he must be one of the main activists of the Polish underground (when in fact he had no communications with the outside world and was not involved in any such activities) and moved to a secure facility in Warsaw. During the November Uprising (1830–1831) he was taken with the Russian troops retreating from Warsaw and put in one of the most secure prisons in Russia, the Shlisselburg.[5] The tsar had given orders that he should not be allowed to speak to any other prisoners or guards; that he was to be kept there even after his sentence expired; and that his family was to remain unaware of his fate. Further, most of the commanders of the Shlisselburg prison were to be unaware of the exact identity of the prisoner.

They began with a display of Sowińska general's funeral, the widow of the legendary commander of the defense of Wola in 1831. Then came the demonstrations during the October conference rulers of the occupying powers, and demonstrations on the anniversary of the November uprising and its subsequent anniversaries of events. Gained great popularity jewelry patriotic decorated with symbols to express faith in the resurrection tormented homeland. Gorchakov governor did not initially respond to the demonstrations, it was only under the pressure of St. Petersburg sent to the streets of Warsaw police and military. The first procession dispersed February 25, 1861, and two days later by a volley of Cossacks donated to the demonstrators killed five people. Gorchakov frustrated, fearing that further clashes could erupt into open fighting, the army withdrew from the streets and agreed to set up in the night from 27 to 28 February City Delegation (Delegacja Miejska) issued on behalf of society Polish address to the Tsar.

The address at which signed up to the most illustrious personalities of the Kingdom, the car did not want to accept. Gorchakov recognizing the danger of an uprising, concealed the fact that the rejection of the address, agreed to ostentatious funeral of the victims of the February clashes, the army and police withdrew from the streets, policing entrusting vigilante. Polish society is not only demonstrated: in fact formed an underground state whose anonymous and mysterious representatives gained more and more hearing in the nation.

# 1861 upheavals


After a series of patriotic riots, the Russian Namestnik (regent) of Tsar Alexander II, General Karl Lambert, introduced martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861. Public gatherings were banned and some public leaders were declared outlaws.

The future leaders of the uprising gathered secretly in St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Vilna, Paris and London. After this series of meetings two major factions emerged. The Reds represented united peasants, workers, and some clergy, while The Whites represented liberal minded landlords and intelligentsia of the time. In 1862 two initiative groups were formed for the two components of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

## The whites: 
  The aristocratic Conservatives were centred in the Hotel Lambert in Paris with Prince Adam Czartoryski as their leader. They established a quasi-government-in-exile.

  The "Whites" (Polish: Biali) were a faction among Polish insurrectionists before and during the January Uprising in early 1860s. They consisted mostly of progressive minded land owners and industrialists, the middle class and some intellectuals of Russian controlled Congress Poland. The faction had its origins in the Towarzystwo Rolnicze (Agricultural Society) started by Count Andrzej Artur Zamoyski in 1858. While the Whites supported ending serfdom, unlike the "Red" faction they advocated for some kind of compensation to be made to the landlords. Also unlike the Reds, the Whites generally opposed the idea of an armed insurrection against Russia, seeing it as doomed to failure, and instead tried to use diplomacy and the support of other European powers to win greater autonomy for Congress Poland, a separate administration and a native Polish army. They also tried to influence the Tsar to engage in the recovery of former Polish lands which had been taken by partitioning powers other than Russia - Austria and Prussia. However, once the January Uprising broke out, most Whites supported it both politically and militarily.

## The Reds:
  The Polish Radicals espoused democratic, republican and sometimes socialistic ideas. Their National Committee, established in Paris and later moved to Brussels, purported to represent the Polish nation, and had as its key figure the historian Joachim Lewelel

  The "Reds" (Polish: Czerwoni) were a faction of the Polish insurrectionists during the January Uprising in 1863. They were radical democratic activists who supported the outbreak of the uprising from the outset, advocated an end to serfdom in Congress and future independent Poland, without compensation to the landlords, land reform and other substantial social reforms. This contrasted them with the "White" faction, which only came to support the Uprising after it was already under way, and which, while also strongly supporting an end to serfdom wanted to compensate the landowners.
In general, the Reds represented liberal intellectuals while the Whites based their support on progressive landlords. The Reds were based in Warsaw and concentrated around the Warsaw Medical Academy, while the Whites' base of support was in Kraków. The Central National Committee (Komitet Centralny Narodowy) formed the leadership basis of the faction.

# 	22 January 1863 – 18 June 1864
Polish: powstanie styczniowe

The uprising began as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Imperial Russian Army. It was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and various politicians. The insurrectionists, severely outnumbered and lacking serious outside support, were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics.
Public executions and deportations to Siberia led many Poles to abandon armed struggle and turn instead to the idea of "organic work": economic and cultural self-improvement.

Presents forced captive to the tsarist army as ordered by Aleksandra Wielopolskiego on the night of 14 on 15 January 1863 in Warsaw . Branka, which was to prevent the outbreak of the uprising, in fact, be accelerated. Power was to take about 12 thousand. Poles suspected of underground activity and participation in the preparations for the uprising. Forced recruitment into the tsarist army went only partially, because the information about the planned brance not been able to keep a secret. Part of the conspirators of the enlisted on January 12 [7] ran away from home, and despite the harsh winter hid in the woods. The leaders of the uprising did not want to passively wait for conscripts will be rounded up by the army and police and decided the night of 22 on January 23 to start the formation [8] .

# Polish National Government 

The Polish National Government 1863–64 was an underground Polish supreme authority during the January Uprising, a large scale insurrection during the Russian partition of the former territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It had a collegial form, resided in Warsaw and was headed by Karol Majewski (pl). This was a normal administrative institution with many ministries and departments.[Davies 2005, p. 261.]
During 1863–1864 it was a real shadow government supported by the majority of Poles who even paid taxes for it, and a significant problem for the Russian secret police (Okhrana). "It organized one of the world's earliest campaigns of urban guerrilla warfare", according to Norman Davies. It became the prototype for the Polish Secret State during World War II. [Davies 2005, pp. 260–261.]

Soon he was promoted to the commissar of the Polish government for the Grodno Voivodeship. His writings made him popular both among the peasants and the gentry, which enabled the partisan units under his command to grow rapidly. Because of his successes he was promoted to the rank of Plenipotentiary Commissar of the Government for Lithuania (Komisarz Pełnomocny Rządu na Litwę), which made him the commander-in-chief of all partisan units fighting in the areas of today's' Eastern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.

The Government of England has made a demonstration in favor of the Poles that cannot fail to excite for their cause the warmest sympathy, and give strength to the insurrectionary movement. The Earl of Ellenborough took occasion in the House of Lords, on the 10th of February, to ask the Ministry for any papers it possessed on the subject cf Poland, and in doing so commented with just severity upon the tyrannies of Russia, and the unhappy condition to which it had reduced the proud and gallant nation of the Poles. This was responded to by Earl Russell, in behalf of the Government .- He did not think it expedient to produce the information sought by the Earl of Ellenborough,  and could not without mature reflection indicate the policy that England would pursue in dealing with the Polish question. He was very decided however, in thinking that Russia had done wrong in her government of Poland and had told the Russian Minister that **the decree of conscription "was the most imprudent and unjust step the Russian Government could take."** This sentiment, we are told, was received with loud cheering, and when the noble Earl went on to say that Prussia had made herself a partner in the wrong by entering into a convention with Russia, the cheering was renewed. These indications of disapprobation showed how aristocratic England regarded the tyrannies of aristocratic Russia. We can well imagine that there must be more than usual pathos in this national cry of Polish anguish to move the cold and august noblemen in the House of Lords. This cry has hushed the strife of parties, for we hear that, immediately upon the conclusion of the Earl of Russell's speech, the Earl of Malmesbury, a member of the Opposition, and a follower of Lord Derry and his foreign secretary, arose, and expressed his approval of the sentiments of the Government; expressed his "sincere sorrow at what he had been told was the attitude of the Russian Government." This demonstration in the House of Lords is everywhere sustained, and the sentiment of England is decidedly in sympathy with the Poles.

---


It may be said to be equally so in France. The Emperor of deeds has said nothing, and,-as yet, does nothing; but French sentiment is decidedly in sympathy with Poland. The ominous mutterings of a muzzled press; the gossip in the saloons ; the debates in the national assemblies; all indicate coldness to Russia and kindness to the suffering people now being massacred by her armies. Austria has taken a high stand, and washes her hands of a transaction which is at best but little more than the natural effect of the perfidy of a former Austrian minister. Prussia has made herself virtually an ally of Russia, by entering into a convention for the purpose of preventing Polish rebels taking refuge in her dominions, and agreeing to return them to the Russian authority. Whether Prussia which, notwithstanding the vacillation and obstinacy of her present ruler, is a proud and just nation, and strongly devoted to the liberal sentiment of Europe -  will consent to become a minion of an autocracy and the instrument of a tyranny which the world cannot equal, remains to be seen. The King of Prussia has done much to estrange his people, and many wise men fear an outbreak against his own authority, and we think it would be well for him not to court additional odium by his conduct in this unfortunate insurrection. Thus far, the insurrection has been little more than a series of outbreaks and massacres, although some of the writers of European journals state that the conduct of the Poles has been marked by humanity and discretion; that they have organized armies, and, under the leadership of a distinguished Polish nobleman, are fast becoming proficient in the art of war.** If this contest should be permitted to continue, we do not see how anything can result but the utter annihilation of the Polish nationality.** It was, indeed, the attempt to carry out this design, by forcing a merciless and unjust conscription, that led to the present insurrection. It is possible that the combined Powers of Europe may present to Russia such a remonstrance that she will desist from her present sad design, and **it is by no means impossible that, out of the revolution and excitement which despairing Poland has created in her effort to become free, the great crime of its partition, which has been for a generation the shame of Europe, will be redressed. As friends of liberty, we shall look upon such result as one of the most pleasant events of the age.** <sup class="tp" title="The Alleghanian. (Ebensburg, Pa.), 19 March 1863.

##    Notes on Polish Uprising Seminar

13.12

Reading Ferrie's 1994 paper on Immigrant Wealth Accumulation informs me of an extensive American census of immigrant ships between 1840 to 1870.
Furthermore, the exact same method used in the article can be used to study the patterns of Polish immigrants after the '63 uprising, perhaps.

### Polish Falcons of America.

[About Us](http://www.polishfalcons.org/history)

Brief History
From its beginnings, Polish identity has been ingrained within the mission and activities of Polish Falcons of America.

For hundreds of years, Poland was a major European economic, political powerhouse and the largest country in Europe. Seen as a threat to the neighboring authoritarian empires of Russia, Prussia and Austria, in the late 1700s Poland was invaded, its vast territory divided and its culture and language suppressed.  This foreign occupation was brutal, lasting over 120 years, and resulted in a series of unsuccessful insurrections against this foreign oppression.

The modern Falcon organization is a direct descendent of a similar organization established in Poland four years after the unsuccessful January Uprising of 1863 against Czarist Russia.   Devoted to physical fitness and physical education, the Polish Falcons adopted the Latin maxim "mens sana in corpore sano," or in Polish, “w Zdrowym Ciele, Zdrowy Duch" - "A Healthy Spirit in a Healthy Body." Such efforts were intended to “regenerate” the Polish nation through disciplined physical fitness, preparing the nation for eventual independence. In this spirit, the first Falcon Nest, or lodge, in the United States was organized by Felix L. Pietrowicz in Chicago, Ill. in 1887.   In 1912, the organization’s headquarters were moved to Pittsburgh, which is centrally located between the two largest centers of Polish-American communities, New York and Chicago.  These American Falcons adopted as their patron the Polish Patriot, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, who fought for both the independence of Poland and the United States.

The vision of a resurrected, free Poland was close to the hearts of the early Falcon organization, which became a leader among Polish-American groups in working toward this goal.  By 1917, over 25,000 young Polish-American men were trained by the Polish Falcons to serve in a proposed Polish military force.  During World War I, these Falcon-trained troops became the core of the Polish-American expeditionary force in France and the eventual nucleus of the Polish Army.  At the Polish Falcons Convention held in Pittsburgh on April 3, 1917, the renowned pianist and future premier of newly independent Poland, Ignacy Paderewski, delivered a rousing speech that sparked the recruitment of a Polish Army in the United States to fight for the Western Allies against Germany.  Over 35,000 Polish-American men enlisted in the Allied war effort.   In particular, these Falcon trained troops fought in the famous “Blue Army” under the leadership of General Jozef Haller. When Poland regained its independence in 1918, these troops helped to form the nucleus of the young country’s armed forces as neighboring countries immediately attacked Poland, including the fierce Bolshevik Red Army that was planning on spreading communism into Europe by invading Poland.

Once Polish independence was secured, the Polish Falcons of America could turn its attention to improving the lives of its Members. The early part of the 20th century was a time when few social services were available and working conditions, particularly for Polish immigrants, were particularly harsh.  There were no public health and recreation programs, no social security or retirement benefits, and conditions in the work place were often dangerous.  Immigrant men were forced to work extremely long hours for little pay, under difficult and often life-threatening conditions.  If the head of the house died in an industrial accident or was incapacitated, the surviving family often faced impoverishment.  Polish Falcons of America addressed these problems by offering life insurance programs for the Polish-American community at reasonable cost. The Falcons also offered recreational activities for Falcon youth in areas where no other such services were available.  And, combined with these and other programs, the Falcons remained loyal to their commitment to the Polish heritage.

## Russian Navy
History:
During the winter of 1861–1862, the Imperial Russian Navy sent two fleets to American waters to avoid their getting trapped if a war broke out with Britain and France. Many Americans at the time viewed this as an intervention on behalf of the Union, though historians deny this.[53] The Alexander Nevsky and the other vessels of the Atlantic squadron stayed in American waters for seven months (September 1863 to June 1864).[54]
