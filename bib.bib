abstract = {With the advent of digital optical scanners, a lot of paper-based books, textbooks, magazines, articles, and documents are being transformed into an electronic version that can be manipulated by a computer. For this purpose, OCR, short for Optical Character Recognition was developed to translate scanned graphical text into editable computer text. Unfortunately, OCR is still imperfect as it occasionally mis-recognizes letters and falsely identifies scanned text, leading to misspellings and linguistics errors in the OCR output text. This paper proposes a post-processing context-based error correction algorithm for detecting and correcting OCR non-word and real-word errors. The proposed algorithm is based on Google " s online spelling suggestion which harnesses an internal database containing a huge collection of terms and word sequences gathered from all over the web, convenient to suggest possible replacements for words that have been misspelled during the OCR process. Experiments carried out revealed a significant improvement in OCR error correction rate. Future research can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can be parallelized and executed over multiprocessing platforms.},

The roots of this discord are found in the diplo matic maneuvering then when France and England threatened to intervene on behalf of the Confederacy thus forcing the Union to maintain close diplo matic ties with Tsarist Russia. It was even rumored in some European gov erning circles that a formal offensive-defensive alliance was signed between the North and the Russian governments. The closing of ranks between Washington and St. Petersburg initially did not seem relevant to nineteenth century Polish national aspirations. However during the course of the Janu ary Uprising Polish hopes of gaining diplomatic and financial aid from the United States were disillusioned when the North anticipating a confrontation with the two western European powers was forced to resort to practical poli tics, i.e. the Russian ties, rather than succumb to the sentiment of traditional Polish-American relations.},

@article{Newman2006,
abstract = {The basis for most information retrieval techniques is the vector space model for text data (Salton {\&} McGill, 1983). In this model, each document in a corpus is represented by a term-frequency vector whose elements are the number of occurrences of each word in the vocabulary. Collectively, the set of these term-frequency vectors forms the document– word matrix representation of the corpus. All the methods we consider have this document–word matrix representation as the starting point. The classic information retrieval method, tf-idf (term-frequency inverse-document-frequency), is used in many search engines today. Despite tf-idf's popularity, it does not handle synonymy and polysemy. Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Landauer, and Harshman (1990) devised Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to address this deficiency. Their method for detecting relevant docu-ments based on words in queries improved upon simple word matching. Their association of words with documents (what they called semantic structure) moves us closer to the notion of topics. For example, LSA allows one to compute whether two documents are topically similar, even if the two documents do not have any words in common. There has been a huge increase in the number of histori-cal primary sources available online. 1 Yet there has been little work done on processing, modeling, or analyzing these recently-available corpora. Previous studies of historic document collections were limited by the number of items a researcher could analyze in a reasonable amount of time. For instance, Clark and Wetherell (1989) analyzed the Penn-sylvania Gazette by sampling less than 10{\%} of the total number of articles in just a 33 year period. Other authors analyzed a single category of a newspaper's content, such as We use a probabilistic mixture decomposition method to determine topics in the Pennsylvania Gazette, a major colonial U.S. newspaper from 1728–1800. We assess the value of several topic decomposition techniques for his-torical research and compare the accuracy and efficacy of various methods. After determining the topics cov-ered by the 80,000 articles and advertisements in the entire 18th century run of the Gazette, we calculate how the prevalence of those topics changed over time, and give historically relevant examples of our findings. This approach reveals important information about the con-tent of this colonial newspaper, and suggests the value of such approaches to a more complete understanding of early American print culture and society.},

Cependant les {\'{e}}tudes de l{\'{o}}pinion victorienne en mati{\`{e}}re d{\'{a}}ffaires {\'{e}}trang{\`{e}}res acceptent simplement que les courants historiques de l{\'{e}}́poque— c{\'{e}}st-{\`{a}}-dire les images st{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}otyp{\'{e}}es d{\'{a}}utres nations, les tendances politiques, et les valeurs religieuses et sociales— s{\'{i}}nt{\`{e}}grent avec les {\'{e}}v{\'{e}}nements de l{\'{e}}́tranger pour en faire l{\'{o}}pinion publique. La propagande n{\'{e}}st gu{\`{e}}re trait{\'{e}}e. Alors se r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rant {\`{a}} la m{\'{e}}thodologie et aux perspectives des sciences sociales, on peut {\'{e}}claircir ce processus. Au d{\'{e}}but des ann{\'{e}}es 1860 les {\'{e}}migr{\'{e}}s polonais en Angleterre soutenaient leur cause avec beaucoup d{\'{e}}́nergie dans la presse, au “Parlement,” et parmi les classes ouvri{\`{e}}res. Leur meilleur succ{\`{e}}s {\'{e}}tait dans la presse, surtout parmi les r{\'{e}}dacteurs {\`{a}} penchant Lib{\'{e}}ral. Au "Parlement" ils ont soulev{\'{e}} douze fois en 1861-62 le probl{\`{e}}me polonais, dont quatre fois pour un d{\'{e}}bat {\'{e}}tendu. Une campagne vigoureuse de r{\'{e}}unions publiques dans tout le pays a produit un bon nombre de p{\'{e}}titions au “Parlement,” qui refl{\'{e}}taient dans une certaine mesure l{\'{o}}pinion de la classe ouvri{\`{e}}re. Malgr{\'{e}} ces succ{\`{e}}s, la propagande polonaise a {\'{e}}chou{\'{e}} dans son but principal, celui de gagner une approbation g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rale pour une initiative diplomatique de la part de l{\'{A}}ngleterre envers la Russie. La propagande polonaise, quoiqu{\'{e}}lle employait des techniques astucieuses, souffrait d{\'{i}}nsuffisances. Les polonais ne pouvaient pas gagner {\`{a}} leur cause l{\'{a}}dh{\'{e}}rance du journal le plus influent, notamment le Times de Londres; ils ne pouvaient pas non plus attirer les caciques du “Parlement”; et enfin leurs manifestations d{\'{e}}pendaient largement de David Urquhart, un eccentrique pas tr{\`{e}}s c{\^{o}}t{\'{e}}. Plus important, le but polonais de provoquer une intervention diplomatique de la part de l{\'{A}}ngleterre ne pouvait pas {\^{e}}tre pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}} comme politique pratique. En g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral, trois {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ments contribuaient {\`{a}} la formation de l{\'{o}}pinion publique: la propagande, les {\'{e}}v{\'{e}}nements en Pologne, et les conditions historiques de l{\'{A}}ngleterre du milieu de l{\`{e}}́re victorienne. La propagande polonaise fut la plus efficace pendant que la contestation en Pologne fut la plus faible: elle fut moins important pendant la p{\'{e}}riode de pleine r{\'{e}}volte en 1863. Bref, les {\'{e}}v{\'{e}}nements eux-m{\^{e}}mes en Pologne contribuaient plus que la propagande polonaise {\`{a}} la formation de l{\'{o}}pinion publique britannique, les circonstances anglaises {\'{e}}tant toujour un facteur important.

abstract = {At least nine million Americans trace their roots to Poland, and Polish Americans have contributed greatly to American history and society. During the largest period of immigration to the United States, between 1870 and 1920, more Poles came to the United States than any other national group except Italians. Additional large-scale Polish migration occurred in the wake of World War II and during the period of Solidarity's rise to prominence.
This encyclopedia features three types of entries: thematic essays, topical entries, and biographical profiles. The essays synthesize existing work to provide interpretations of, and insight into, important aspects of the Polish American experience. The topical entries discuss in detail specific places, events or organizations such as the Polish National Alliance, Polish American Saturday Schools, and the Latimer Massacre, among others. The biographical entries identify Polish Americans who have made significant contributions at the regional or national level either to the history and culture of the United States, or to the development of American Polonia.},

abstract = {"In this history of "Polonia" - the community of Polish immigrants and their descendants residing in America - James S. Pula defines what it has meant to be Polish in America since the first large groups of Poles left the Old Country - what they called Stary Kraj - for the New more than 150 years ago." "The Polish American community has long been identified with three characteristics that the early immigrants brought with them to America, writes Pula: "an affection and concern for their ancestral homeland, a deep religious faith, and a sense of shared cultural values." Prominent among these values are family loyalty, a desire for property ownership, and pride in self-sufficiency. Throughout the book Pula returns to these themes as Polish Americans have played them out against the backdrop of Polish and American history."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

abstract = {Drawing on the international literature on migration and immigrant associations, mainly in the context of North and South America, but also including several other global immigration contexts, this essay highlights several main questions and issues. It discusses the definition of voluntary associations and the principal impetus for associational activities among immigrant newcomers. Using examples from specific types of organisation (secret societies, credit associations, mutual benefit societies, religious groups, hometown associations, political groups), it examines the factors that shape immigrants' formal sociability. The paper then addresses the class and gender composition of memberships, compares the associative practices of the mostly European immigrants of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with the mostly Asian, Latin American and African arrivals of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and discusses the issue of state involvement. The essay approaches the topic from a ...},
